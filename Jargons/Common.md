1. **1-indexed array** means the need to assume the array starts from an index of 1.
2. **Predicate** means a statement that determines whether a value could be true or false. In programming predicates mean functions with one argument that return a boolean value. In java there's a functional interface dedicated for this.
3. ```O(1)``` space complexity in string means that you don't use ```String.substring()``` function.
