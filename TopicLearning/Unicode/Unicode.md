1. In Unicode format uppercase letters come before lowercase letters and are separated by 
some other characters in between which are not a part of english alphabets and are 6 in number so 
`'A'` is separated by `'a'` by a value of 32 instead of 26.
2. 0 is before 1 in unicode so no issue in using it straightly as a char value to compare if it exists in 
string form. i.e. Can compare '0' straight with '1' in string "01" if need be in some question.
