1. Start and end will both come from mid in most of the cases so apply conditions there so you can assume it ran on start and end as well.
2. 2 base cases will be there in the very end:
    a. start val end
    b. start val val end
3. IMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMP: Very good tree traversal in the current commit.
