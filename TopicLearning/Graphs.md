1. Nodes in a binary tree if all nodes are filled till a certain level = (2^h - 1) (<- remember the -1 its for the root level) or 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2... 
2. IMPPPP - Above line meaning the number of nodes in the last line = sum of all the nodes above it + 1. -- rule used in same commit...
3. Number of elements at every row is 2 * h. Where height starts from 0 or if it starts from 1 then height - 1.
4. Its best to keep root's height as 0 easier while finding height of a tree as you won't have to end up with (node is null) condition in the loop.
5. IMP::: for level 4 (actually 5) there will be 16 values in the row and the total node count till the last node will be 31.
