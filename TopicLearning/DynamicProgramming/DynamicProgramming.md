Don't confuse dynamic programming with memoization as they're not exactly same. If in case you can't find a distinctive and sure way to implement subproblems while using recursion its most likely will result in TLE, it would be better to just use 2 for loops to directly compute the DP rather than using recursion + memoization for the same.
