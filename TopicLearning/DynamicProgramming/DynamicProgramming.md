Don't confuse dynamic programming with memoization as they're not exactly same. If in case you can't find a distinctive and sure way to implement subproblems while using recursion its most likely will result in TLE, it would be better to just use 2 for loops to directly compute the DP rather than using recursion + memoization for the same. See ques: Longest [Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/) for more.
Morover memoization is specifically about caching the results of recursive calls to avoid redundant computations. It’s a form of top-down dynamic programming where the recursion tree is pruned by storing the results. Whereas dynamic programming, in the more classical sense, is often about iterating over subproblems in a table, filling in results iteratively (this is the bottom-up approach), and can sometimes be done without explicit recursion.
