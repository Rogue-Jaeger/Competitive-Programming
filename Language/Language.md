Java:
------------------------------------------------

Why does `Integer num = 77` works but `StringBuilder sb = "ffjlk"` doesn't? </br>
The reason is because of something called _**AutoBoxing**_ in java... This is a language level feature 
and can't be implemented by custom classes (_Our user owned classes_.)
