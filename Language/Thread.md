Java:
================================================

Semaphores: 
------------------------------------------------
Basically restricts the running of threads through `acquire(_number of slots_)` function, Which will wait until the required number of slots are available. 
Which will be made available through `release(_number of slots_)`.</br>
**NOTE:** `Semaphore sm = new Semaphore(_initial slots_)` : Here initial slots can be **0** and still if `sm.release(2)` is called on the semaphore it'll again give out **2** slots.
